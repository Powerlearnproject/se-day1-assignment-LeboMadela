#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products. Software engineering plays an important role in the technology industry as it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare. It's indeed the backbone of this digital times we are in.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- In 1960s software engineering was established as a discipline.
- In 1970s structured programming emerged.
- In 2000s agile methodologies arose.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle consists of requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenace phases. Briefly explained:
  - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall and Agile are two of the most widely used methodologies in software development, and they represent very different approaches to how software is built. 
- Waterfall is a linear, step-by-step approach with distinct phases - where each step must be completed before moving to the next. This method is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements, strict timelines where little to no alteraction is expected once development starts.
- Agile uses an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. This method is ideal for dynamic, evolving projects, such as startups or products that require frequent iterations, user feedback, and adaptability.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
- Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
- Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) are crucial software engineering tools as they enhance productivity, collaboration, and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control, debugging tools, and automated testing capabilities. 
IDEs in short are Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (for example: Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA). While VCS entails Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (for example: Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers faces various changes throughout the development process such as changing requirements, tight deadlines and technical debt. Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
- Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
- System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
- Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Testing is a critical aspect of Quality Assurance and each type of testing plays an important role in the overall software quality assurance process. Unit testing focuses on catching bugs early at the component level, while integration testing ensures that modules work well together. System testing validates that the entire software works as expected in a real-world context, and acceptance testing ensures that the software meets the business goals and user needs before it is deployed.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of asking AI the right questions in the right way to get the best answers. Itâ€™s like giving clear instructions or asking a well-thought-out question so that the response is accurate, useful, and relevant to what you need. It is important because the way you ask something can change how the AI responds. For example, if you want a detailed answer, asking a vague question will likely give you a vague answer. By carefully shaping your prompt, you can get the information you need quickly and with less hallucination and back-and-forth.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Tell me about climate change." - This prompt is too broad and unspecific, so the response could cover a wide range of topics related to climate change, from scientific facts to political debates, or even just general information. It lacks direction.
Improved Prompt: "Explain the main causes of climate change in 150 words, focusing on human activities like deforestation and fossil fuel use."
The improved prompt is more effective because it is:
- Clear: The AI understands exactly what aspect of climate change to focus on.
- Specific: The topic is narrowed down to human activities, leading to a targeted response.
- Concise: The word count constraint guides the AI to provide a concise and focused answer, saving time and effort.
